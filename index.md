![My Profile Photo](/assets/img/Portfolio_Photo.jpg)


In case you're curious, this photo is me in Patagonia—about 100 miles from the end of the world.  

### If I’m not exploring the world as an adventurous traveler, I’m engineering marketing science.  

I went to school for advertising but fell in love with data visualization, which led me to a career in analytics.  

I specialize in A/B testing, landing pages, digital campaign analysis, and SEO performance tracking. I create custom web tags using JavaScript and collaborate with teams across sales and finance. My experience is multifaceted—I’ve worked across marketing analytics, ABM campaign reporting, and business intelligence.  

**Niche started my career, but breadth keeps me employed.**  

I like to stay competitive, and my previous roles have pushed me deeper into business intelligence. I’ve developed forecasts, built dashboards, and captured user journeys from product purchases to subscription connections. I work with Tableau, Power BI, SAP, Salesforce, Kochava for mobile app attribution, and ELT pipelines using BigQuery.  

### Currently open to new opportunities  
I'm actively working on projects through Upwork and always looking to connect with like-minded professionals. Let’s collaborate!
