<h1>👋 Hi, I'm Christopher</h1>


![My Profile Photo](/assets/img/Portfolio_Photo.jpg)


In case you're curious, this photo is me in Patagonia—about 100 miles from the end of the world.  

### If I’m not exploring the world as an adventurous traveler, I’m engineering marketing science.  

I went to school for advertising but fell in love with data visualization, which led me to a career in analytics.  

I specialize in A/B testing, landing pages, digital campaign analysis, and SEO performance tracking. I create custom web tags using JavaScript and collaborate with teams across sales and finance. My experience is multifaceted—I’ve worked across marketing analytics, ABM campaign reporting, and business intelligence.  

**Niche started my career, but breadth keeps me employed.**  

I like to stay competitive, and my previous roles have pushed me deeper into business intelligence. I’ve developed forecasts, built dashboards, and captured user journeys from product purchases to subscription connections. I work with Tableau, Power BI, SAP, Salesforce, Kochava for mobile app attribution, and ELT pipelines using BigQuery.  

### Currently open to new opportunities  
I'm actively working on projects through Upwork and always looking to connect with like-minded professionals. Let’s collaborate!

## 💥 Here's how I deliver value 🚀

- **Marketing & Web Analytics**  
  I help teams understand how users really behave. With tools like **GA4**, **Google Tag Manager**, and **Tealium**, I set up smart tracking strategies that fuel smarter decisions and better digital experiences.

- **Campaign Optimization & A/B Testing**  
  I run **A/B and multivariate tests** that actually move the needle—whether it’s landing pages, emails, or paid media. My focus is on **conversion rate optimization (CRO)**, engagement, and retention.

- **Dashboarding & Reporting That Drives Action**  
  I turn marketing data into dashboards that people actually use—built in **Power BI**, **Looker Studio**, and **Google Data Studio**—to track KPIs, find trends, and guide strategy.

- **Marketing Measurement & Modeling**  
  I’m all about connecting the dots. From **attribution modeling** to **media mix modeling** and **marketing mix modeling (MMM)**, I help teams see what’s working and where to double down—pulling insights from platforms like **Kochava**, **Salesforce**, **SFMC**, **Pardot**, and more.

- **Full-Funnel Performance Analytics**  
  I analyze the full journey—from lead to conversion to retention—using **multi-touch attribution**, cohort analysis, and lifecycle mapping. The goal? Better targeting, better results, and better ROI.
