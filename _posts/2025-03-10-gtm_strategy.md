## 🚀 How to Build a Winning Go-To-Market Strategy for Your Travel App

I used to travel frequently, often spending months at a time abroad. My typical itinerary included extended trips across countries, especially in **Southeast Asia**—covering Thailand, South Korea, Cambodia, and the Philippines over about four months. Even though I tried language apps like **Duolingo, Preply, and Rosetta Stone**, I consistently felt lost as soon as I got past customs, unable to quickly adapt to local contexts.

After spending six months collaborating with skilled freelancers on Upwork, I've finally built the perfect app to solve this very problem. Now, the challenge is figuring out how to effectively break into the market with a **limited budget** at 29 years old and bootstrapping everything myself.
